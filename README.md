# Security_System-ECE273-Project2-
## Summary
Design a simple security system consisting of a Card Reader and a Key Pad. <br>
A person may open a door if he or she has a card containing the corresponding code, and enters an authorized key pad code for that card. <br>
A person is given only two chances to key in the correct code after which an alarm will go off. <br>
The alarm also goes off if the card has the wrong code on it. <br>
If the correct key pad code is entered, the corresponding door will be unlocked when the card is inserted. <br>
_NOTE: The three bits C, D, E are set first. Then the card is inserted and the keypad code is checked. If the code is wrong, the card can be removed and reinserted after a new keypad code is set_ <br> <br>
**Files available are:**<br>
  1) Pdf report that conatins all of the below,along with detialed procedure <br>
  2) PlanAhead Generated Physical constraints <br>
  3) Test bench code to test a few sample example <br>
  4) Pictures of the main schematic and waveforms <br> <br>
_Note that all labs are required to have an example test bench and waveforms to display theoretical sucess along with a demo to demonstrate actaul success_
